    <h4>The Basic Idea</h4>
    <p>When calculating the cost of a car it may be useful to estimate the useful life for the vehicle in miles. It's also a good to know how much driving you expect to do on a yearly basis. Using these assumptions, along with the current mileage and price of a car, you can estimate how many useful months remain for the car and how much each of these months will cost you.</p>
    <h4>Months Remaining</h4>
    <p>This is calculated by taking the total useful life (in miles) and subtracting the current miles. You then divide this by how many miles you expect to drive per month.</p>
    <h4>Cost Per Remaining Month</h4>
    <p>This is calculated by dividing a vehicle's price by how many months are remaining.</p>
    <h4>Default Values</h4>
    <p>The default values used for "useful life" is 150,000 miles. The default value for "expected miles driven" in a year is 15,000. These values can be customized by visiting your

    <h4>These are Rough Approximations</h4>
    <p>Understand these metrics are very simplied approximations to better compare vehicles assuming all else is equal.</p>
    <h4>All Else Equal</h4>
    <p>All else equal is impossible as no two cars are exactly the same. Some vehicles are more expensive for a reason. Also, vehicles typically have a resale or residual value, at the end of it's useful life.</p>
    <h4>Residual Value</h4>
    <p>Residual value is not considered in the "cost per remaining months" metric. Keep in mind that many vehicles will likely have a residual value and certain vehicles "retain their value" better than others.</p>
    <h4>Use These Metrics as a Guide.</h4>
    <p>Despite the difficulties in comparing different vehicles as it relates to features, resale value, etc. these metrics can be helpful in comaring vehicles. <a href="/create-item">Add a Car</a> to your list to get started.</p>

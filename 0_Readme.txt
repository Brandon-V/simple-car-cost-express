Course: Learn Javascript: Full Stack from Scratch
Source: Udemy
Instructor: Learn Web Code (Brad Schiff)

19 hours of video

CRUD Using mongodb and node
Flash Mssages is cool
User Registration with Validation and following capabilities
Search feature is cool but basic
Chat feature using socket.io is very badass!
Created an api for the first time!
Note: Watched the sendgrid video but did not configure app to send emails

Next Steps: 
Can leverage these skills to build "CarCost" app to create "car idea list items" instead of posts. Save "car idea list items" in db instead of browser local storage.

Goals of the Custom App:

Allow password protection for users to create a profile and save to a database car-list-items with input fields for title, miles, cost and link and calculated values of 1.) number of remaining months and 2.) Cost per remaining months (based on defaults but also customizable). Need to be able to update fields, delete fields, and sort list items.

may want to start with simple to do list first and then progress to more complicated list.
